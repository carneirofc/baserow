# Data destinations, backups and datalake exports

Baserow can write two kinds of data to storage outside the instance:

* **Backups** — the regular workspace export archive (structure and rows, signed and
  checksummed), uploaded to external storage and restorable onto this or a fresh
  instance.
* **Datalake exports** — the rows of database tables as Parquet files, on a schedule,
  full the first time and incremental afterwards, for a datalake to ingest.

Both write to a **data destination**: an S3 or S3-compatible bucket, an Azure Blob
Storage container, or a mounted filesystem.

In the app, backups live under the workspace menu → **Backups** (back up now, restore,
schedules and external storage), and datalake exports under a database's menu →
**Datalake exports**. Everything below is also available through the API and management
commands.

## Declaring destinations

Destinations are declared by the operator with the `BASEROW_DATA_DESTINATIONS`
environment variable, a JSON list. Credentials live only there — never in the database
or in API responses. Schedules and API calls refer to a destination by its `name`.

Every destination has:

| Key | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | yes | A url-safe slug schedules refer to. |
| `type` | yes | `s3`, `azure` or `filesystem`. |
| `prefix` | no | Key prefix everything is written under. |
| `purposes` | no | Subset of `["backup", "datalake"]`, both by default. A destination can only be used for the purposes it lists. |
| `allow_trust_public_key` | no | Allow a staff member to trust the signing key of a backup made by another instance when restoring from here. `false` by default. |

Any secret can be given as `<key>_file` instead of inline: the file is read at startup,
which works with Docker and Kubernetes secret mounts. Unknown keys, a half key pair or an
unreadable secret file stop the instance at startup with an explanatory error.

### S3 and S3-compatible storage

Requires `bucket`. Optional: `region`, `endpoint_url` (MinIO, Ceph RGW, …),
`addressing_style`, `signature_version`, `use_ssl`, `verify`, `access_key_id`,
`secret_access_key`, `session_token`. Without static keys, the standard AWS credential
chain is used (IRSA, Pod Identity, instance profile).

```json
[
  {
    "name": "lake",
    "type": "s3",
    "bucket": "baserow-lake",
    "endpoint_url": "http://minio:9000",
    "addressing_style": "path",
    "purposes": ["datalake"],
    "access_key_id_file": "/run/secrets/minio/access-key-id",
    "secret_access_key_file": "/run/secrets/minio/secret-access-key"
  }
]
```

### Azure Blob Storage

Requires `container` and one of `account_key`, `connection_string` or `sas_token`, plus
`account_name` unless a connection string is given. Optional: `endpoint_suffix`,
`custom_domain`.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "offsite",
    "type": "azure",
    "container": "baserow-backups",
    "account_name": "examplestorage",
    "account_key_file": "/run/secrets/azure/account-key",
    "purposes": ["backup"]
  }
]
```

### Filesystem

Requires an absolute `root`, typically a mounted volume or PVC that is available to the
backend and Celery worker containers.

```json
[{"name": "nas", "type": "filesystem", "root": "/mnt/baserow-exports"}]
```

`GET /api/data-destinations/` lists the configured names, types and purposes.

For Docker Compose, set the variable in `.env`; the root `docker-compose.yaml` forwards
it. For Helm, see [Install with Helm](install-with-helm.md#data-destinations).

## Backups to a destination

Pass a `destination` when starting a backup or creating a backup schedule:

```sh
curl -X POST "$BASEROW/api/backups/workspace/1/async/" \
  -H "Authorization: JWT $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"destination": "offsite"}'
```

The archive is made as usual, then uploaded to
`backups/workspace=<id>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.zip` with a `.zip.json` sidecar describing it
(workspace, applications, checksum, signing key, schedule). The sidecar is written last:
an archive without one is an incomplete upload and is ignored. A schedule's `keep_last`
and `keep_days` apply to the backups it uploaded too.

Listing and restoring work from the destination alone, so they also work on a fresh
instance whose database is gone:

```sh
# The API
GET  /api/backups/destinations/<name>/workspace/<workspace_id>/
POST /api/backups/destinations/<name>/workspace/<workspace_id>/restore/
     {"key": "backups/workspace=1/20260101T030000Z_<uuid>.zip"}

# Or the management commands
./baserow list_destination_backups --destination offsite --workspace-id 1
./baserow restore_from_destination --destination offsite --workspace-id 7 \
    --user-email admin@example.com --key backups/workspace=1/20260101T030000Z_<uuid>.zip
./baserow backup_to_destination 1 --destination offsite --user-email admin@example.com
```

Restored applications are installed as new applications. The archive's checksum is
verified against the sidecar first.

Archives are signed with a key of the instance that made them. Restoring one made by
another instance fails with `ERROR_UNTRUSTED_PUBLIC_KEY` until its key is trusted: a staff
member can pass `"trust_public_key": true` (or `--trust-public-key`) when the destination
sets `allow_trust_public_key`, and only if the key inside the archive matches the one in
the sidecar.

## Datalake exports

A table export schedule exports some or all tables of a database to a destination
declared for the `datalake` purpose:

```sh
curl -X POST "$BASEROW/api/database/data-export/schedules/workspace/1/" \
  -H "Authorization: JWT $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"database_id": 12, "name": "Hourly to lake", "cron": "0 * * * *",
       "destination": "lake", "table_ids": [34, 35]}'
```

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET/POST schedules/workspace/<workspace_id>/` | List or create schedules. |
| `GET/PATCH/DELETE schedules/<id>/` | Read, change or delete a schedule. |
| `POST schedules/<id>/run/` | Export now, `{"mode": "auto" \| "full" \| "incremental"}`. |
| `GET schedules/<id>/runs/` | The last runs, one per table. |
| `POST schedules/<id>/reset-state/` | Forget watermarks; the next export of every table is full. |

Exports run with the permissions of the user who created or last updated the schedule,
re-checked on every run. To drive exports from an external scheduler instead, create
an inactive schedule and run it with:

```sh
./baserow export_table_parquet --schedule-id 3 [--table-id 34] [--mode full]
```

### Layout

Every run of a table is published as:

```
tables/workspace=<id>/database=<id>/table=<id>/schedule=<id>/
  mode=full|incremental/run=<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>_<run id>/
    part-00000.parquet
    part-00001.parquet
    _manifest.json
    _SUCCESS
  _state/latest.json
```

**Ignore a run without `_SUCCESS`.** The manifest lists the files with their row counts
and checksums, the columns with their Baserow field id, name and type, the snapshot
moment and the reason a run was full.

Columns: `id`, `created_on`, `updated_on`, `_deleted`, `_run_id`, `_extracted_at`, then
one column per field, named `field_<id>` so renaming a field never breaks the lake
schema (`column_naming: "field_name"` uses sanitized names instead). Values are typed:
decimals, dates and timestamps, booleans, structs for select options and users, lists
for links, multiple selects and files. Formula, lookup and rollup fields follow their
result type. Password fields and form edit links are never exported.

### Merging into the lake

* A **full** run (`"semantics": "replace"`) holds every row, including trashed rows with
  `_deleted = true`, and replaces the table.
* An **incremental** run (`"semantics": "upsert"`) holds the rows whose `updated_on`
  changed since the previous run, trashed ones included. Merge by `id`, keep the row
  with the highest `updated_on`, then drop rows where `_deleted` is true.

An incremental run deliberately reaches back
`BASEROW_DATA_EXPORT_WATERMARK_OVERLAP_SECONDS` (300 by default) before the previous
snapshot, to catch rows committed late, so the same row version can arrive twice — the
merge above makes that harmless.

A run is full instead of incremental when the table was never exported, its exported
fields changed, `full_every_n` incremental runs happened since the last full one, or the
previous run is older than `HOURS_UNTIL_TRASH_PERMANENTLY_DELETED` (rows permanently
deleted in between could not be reported otherwise). Schedule at least that often; the
schedule's `warnings` say when the cron expression does not.

For example, with DuckDB:

```sql
SELECT * FROM read_parquet(
  's3://baserow-lake/tables/workspace=1/database=12/table=34/schedule=3/mode=full/*/part-*.parquet',
  hive_partitioning = true
);
```

### Performance and limits

* Rows are read in chunks of `BASEROW_DATA_EXPORT_CHUNK_SIZE` from one consistent
  snapshot and written to `BASEROW_DATA_EXPORT_TMP_DIR` before upload; size that
  directory for the largest table.
* Incremental exports filter on `updated_on`, which is not indexed by default. On large
  tables run `./baserow create_updated_on_indexes [--table-id <id>]`.
* Values of formula, lookup and rollup fields that change because a *referenced* row
  changed do not always move `updated_on`; the periodic full export (`full_every_n`)
  brings them up to date.
* Decimal columns use 38 digits of precision, the maximum most Parquet readers support.

See [Configuration](configuration.md#backup-and-contents-api-configuration) for every
related environment variable.
