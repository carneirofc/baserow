# Introduction

Saveroom plugins let you fully customize and extend Saveroom quickly and easily. Multiple
plugins can be installed into a new or existing Saveroom installation, they get full
access to Saveroom's internals for maximum customization and are straightforward develop
and publish.

Some examples of what you can do with a Saveroom plugin are:

* Add new Saveroom:
    * Field Types
    * View Types/Filters/Sorts/Decorations/Aggregations
    * Formula Functions/Types
* Add or customize pages, components, styling
* Integrate with 3rd party APIs or software
* Install custom postgres extensions, system packages, python and node dependencies
* And much more!

Saveroom Plugins are only available for self-hosted installations currently and are 
**experimental** and subject to change.

1. **You should always make backups of your Saveroom data before installing and using any
   plugin.**
2. **You should only ever install plugins from a trusted source.**
3. **Saveroom is not responsible for and does not officially support any plugins
   currently, installing and using them is entirely at your own risk.**
