# Write Baserow Backend Tests

Use this skill when a task is to add, fix, or extend a backend test in `backend/tests`.

Do not invent a generic Django testing style. This repo already has strong pytest and fixture conventions. Start by finding the closest existing test in the same backend area and copy its setup shape.

## First Step

Before editing, identify the test target:

1. Handler, service, registry, or model logic
2. API view or serializer behavior
3. Signals, permissions, or settings-sensitive behavior
4. Query-count or performance-sensitive behavior

Then inspect the nearest existing test file in the same module area.

Useful searches:

Use `rg` as a faster equivalent when it is available.

- `find backend/tests -type f | grep 'test_.*\.py$'`
- `grep -RInE "@pytest\\.mark\\.django_db|api_client|data_fixture" backend/tests`
- `grep -RInE "pytest\\.raises|@patch\\(|override_settings|django_assert_num_queries" backend/tests`

## Tooling Used In This Repo

Current backend tests use:

- `pytest`
- `pytest-django`
- Django `reverse`
- DRF `APIClient` from the shared `api_client` fixture
- Shared fixtures from `backend/src/baserow/test_utils/pytest_conftest.py`
- The `data_fixture` fixture builder

Important local files:

- `backend/src/baserow/test_utils/pytest_conftest.py`

`pytest_conftest.py` already provides `data_fixture`, `api_client`, `api_request_factory`, registry reset helpers, env helpers, and automatic signal deferral. Reuse those instead of building bespoke fixtures unless the nearby test already does something more specific.

## Choose The Right Pattern

### Handler, service, and model tests

For core business logic, keep the test direct:

1. Mark the test with `@pytest.mark.django_db` when it touches the database.
2. Build state with `data_fixture`.
3. Instantiate the handler or call the target function directly.
4. Assert concrete persisted state, returned values, and raised exceptions.

Good examples:

- `backend/tests/baserow/core/test_core_handler.py`
- `backend/tests/baserow/core/service/test_service_handler.py`
- `backend/tests/baserow/contrib/automation/test_automation_handler.py`

Use `pytest.raises(...)` for error paths. Prefer asserting the specific domain exception over broad response or string checks when testing non-API code.

### API view tests

For API endpoints, match the common DRF style:

1. Create a user and token with `data_fixture.create_user_and_token()` when JWT auth is needed.
2. Build the URL with `reverse(...)`.
3. Call `api_client.get`, `post`, `patch`, or `delete`.
4. Pass auth as `HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=f"JWT {token}"`.
5. Assert both status code and the relevant response body fields.

Good examples:

- `backend/tests/baserow/api/groups/test_workspace_views.py`
- `backend/tests/baserow/contrib/database/api/rows/test_row_views.py`

Prefer focused payload assertions. Only construct a large expected JSON object when the endpoint response shape is the behavior being tested.

### Signals and side effects

When the important behavior is that a signal or side effect fires:

1. Patch the exact function or signal send call used by the code.
2. Exercise the handler or API path.
3. Assert the mock was called with the expected domain objects or IDs.

Good examples:

- `backend/tests/baserow/core/test_core_handler.py`
- `backend/tests/baserow/core/notifications/test_notifications_signals.py`

The shared test setup already defers many heavy async tasks. Do not add extra mocking for those unless the test specifically needs to assert the call.

### Settings and query-count sensitive tests

Use the repo helpers already in use nearby:

1. Use `override_settings(...)` when the behavior is controlled by Django settings.
2. Use `django_assert_num_queries(...)` only when query count is part of the contract.

Good examples:

- `backend/tests/baserow/config/test_read_replica_router.py`

Do not turn ordinary behavior tests into performance tests.

## Fixtures And Data Setup

Prefer fixture builders over hand-rolling model graphs:

1. Use `data_fixture` for backend objects.
2. Reuse `api_client` instead of instantiating `APIClient` manually.

If you need an entity you have not used before, start by checking `pytest_conftest.py` and nearby test files instead of guessing the fixture name.

## File Placement

Follow the existing test tree under `backend/tests/baserow/**`.

Keep the new test near the feature area rather than creating a new generic test module.

## Validation

Run the narrowest relevant test command first.

Examples:

- `just b test baserow/core/test_core_handler.py`
- `just b test baserow/api/groups/test_workspace_views.py`
- `just b test baserow/contrib/automation/test_automation_handler.py`

If you changed settings-sensitive or query-count-sensitive tests, check the exact failure instead of weakening the assertion immediately.

## Guardrails

- Do not introduce `unittest.TestCase` or Django `TestCase` patterns when the repo already uses plain pytest functions.
- Do not manually construct large object graphs if `data_fixture` already provides the needed factory.
- Do not over-mock core handlers, models, or registries when a focused real-object test is practical.
- Do not skip `@pytest.mark.django_db` on database-touching tests.
- Do not use broad API assertions when the behavior can be proved with a few targeted fields.
