## Baserow FOSS fork: a no-code database, app builder and automation platform

This is a fork of [Baserow](https://baserow.io) with the proprietary editions removed,
intended as a clean open source starting point.

Upstream Baserow is open-core: most of it is MIT licensed, but the `premium/` and
`enterprise/` directories are covered by separate licenses that require a paid
subscription for production use and forbid redistribution. This fork deletes those
directories entirely, so **everything here is MIT licensed** (documentation under
CC BY-SA 4.0) and free for commercial and private use.

* A spreadsheet database hybrid combining ease of use and powerful data organization.
* Create applications and portals, and publish them on your own domain.
* Automate repetitive workflows with automations.
* Visualize your data with dashboards.
* Headless and API first.
* Self-hosted with no storage restrictions and no license checks.
* Uses popular frameworks and tools like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/),
  [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

## What this fork removes

Deleting the paid directories removes the features they implemented. What remains is the
full MIT core: databases, grid/gallery/form views, the application builder, automations,
dashboards, integrations, webhooks, the REST API and the plugin system.

Removed with `premium/`:
Kanban, calendar and timeline views; row comments; AI fields; JSON, XML, Excel and file
exports; personal views; row coloring; survey form mode; the premium admin panel.

Removed with `enterprise/`:
role-based access control; teams; SSO/SAML; audit log; field-level permissions; secure
file serve; data sync; the code runner; the AI assistant.

The plugin system is untouched, so these can be reimplemented as third party plugins.
Anything reimplemented here must be written from scratch — the removed code is not
licensed for reuse.

In addition, this fork removes generative AI end to end — not just the premium AI
fields and enterprise AI assistant, but the underlying pgvector embeddings service and
AI infrastructure, so there is no AI code path left in the core.

## What this fork adds

These are net-new features built from scratch under the MIT license, on top of the
stripped-down core.

### Env-configured OpenID Connect (OIDC) SSO

Enterprise SSO/SAML was deleted with `enterprise/`, but this fork reintroduces
single sign-on as a small, self-contained OIDC implementation configured entirely
through environment variables — no admin UI, no database provider rows to manage. It
works with any OpenID Connect provider (Keycloak/RHBK, Authentik, Zitadel, Entra ID,
Okta, …) and is validated at startup, so a bad configuration fails fast.

The IdP only defines **global profiles** through roles in its token — who may sign in,
who is staff and who is superuser. Everything inside a workspace is managed in the app, so
creating workspaces never needs an IdP or environment change.

* **`BASEROW_OIDC_PROVIDERS`** — a JSON list of providers: `issuer`, `client_id` /
  `client_secret`, claim overrides and the profile mappings below.
* **Profiles** — `user_roles` (may sign in), `staff_roles` and `superuser_roles`, the last
  two reconciled on every login.
* **Deny by default** — a provider that maps any role refuses (and never provisions) a
  user holding none of them.
* **`BASEROW_OIDC_ONLY`** — password signup and login off for normal users, with a
  staff **break-glass** password login so an IdP outage cannot lock you out.
* **Auto-provisioning** — SSO users are created on first login even with signups disabled.

```json
BASEROW_OIDC_PROVIDERS='[{
  "name": "rhbk",
  "display_name": "Company SSO",
  "issuer": "https://keycloak.example.com/realms/main",
  "client_id": "baserow",
  "client_secret": "change-me",
  "user_roles": ["baserow-user"],
  "staff_roles": ["baserow-staff"]
}]'
```

### In-app workspace access

Workspace admins manage who is in their workspace and what they can do:

* **Add members** — pick users who already signed in, by name or email, without an
  invitation.
* **Teams** — group members.
* **Access levels** — *No access*, *Viewer*, *Editor* or *Builder* per member or team, on
  the workspace default, a database or a table; the most specific wins. Staff can manage
  access in any workspace.

**Full guide: [Single sign-on with OpenID Connect](docs/installation/sso-oidc.md)** —
every provider key, in-app workspace access, the login decision flow, a complete
multi-provider example, Docker/Compose/Helm wiring, RHBK/Keycloak setup, error codes and
troubleshooting. A step-by-step Keycloak walkthrough lives in
[the RHBK/Keycloak guide](docs/installation/sso-rhbk-keycloak.md).

### Per-application-type admin feature flags

An instance administrator can switch whole application types off — databases, the
application builder, dashboards and automations — for everyone on the instance.

* **Four toggles** — `enable_database`, `enable_builder`, `enable_dashboard` and
  `enable_automation`, all on by default. Only global staff can change them; a
  workspace ADMIN cannot.
* **Admin UI or API** — flip them under **Admin → Settings → Application features**, or
  send `PATCH /api/settings/update/` as a staff user.
* **Refused everywhere** — a disabled type is gone from the **Create new** menu, creating
  one returns `400 ERROR_APPLICATION_TYPE_DISABLED`, and existing applications of that
  type are hidden from listings and denied on every request (including published builder
  pages and database API tokens).
* **Nothing is deleted** — the data stays in place, and enabling the type again brings
  every application back exactly as it was.
* **No redeploy** — these are database-backed settings, not environment variables, and
  take effect on the next request.

```jsonc
// PATCH /api/settings/update/  (Authorization: JWT <staff token>)
{ "enable_builder": false, "enable_dashboard": false, "enable_automation": false }
```

**Full guide: [Turning application types off instance-wide](docs/installation/instance-settings.md)** —
what each toggle blocks, the admin page and API, scripting the settings after an
install, and a worked database-only example.

## Telemetry

This fork makes no outbound calls to Baserow B.V. or anyone else. The upstream
onboarding flow shipped a pre-checked box that sent your users' email, role, company
size and country to `api.baserow.io`; that has been removed.

Error reporting and product analytics have been removed entirely. One optional
observability hook remains, and is off unless you turn it on:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BASEROW_ENABLE_OTEL` | unset | OpenTelemetry traces, to the endpoint you supply |

It is a FOSS client and only ever reports to the endpoint you configure.

## Run the container

This fork publishes its own all-in-one image to the GitHub Container Registry, so you do
**not** need the upstream `baserow/baserow` image (which ships the premium and enterprise
editions). The image is built straight from this repository's source, so it contains the
fork's changes — the AI removal and the OIDC SSO described above.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name baserow \
  -e BASEROW_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost \
  -v baserow_data:/baserow/data \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/carneirofc/baserow/baserow:latest
```

Then open [http://localhost](http://localhost). Baserow stores everything (Postgres,
Redis, uploads) inside the `baserow_data` volume.

* Set `BASEROW_PUBLIC_URL` to `https://YOUR_DOMAIN` or `http://YOUR_IP` for external
  access — it must match the address you use in the browser.
* Pin a specific release instead of `latest` with a version tag, e.g.
  `ghcr.io/carneirofc/baserow/baserow:0.15.0`.
* To enable SSO, pass the `BASEROW_OIDC_PROVIDERS` (and optionally `BASEROW_OIDC_ONLY`)
  environment variables — see
  [Passing the configuration to Baserow](docs/installation/sso-oidc.md#passing-the-configuration-to-baserow).

Images are published automatically by the
[`build-publish-image`](.github/workflows/build-publish-image.yml) GitHub Actions
workflow whenever a `v*` version tag is pushed; the `latest` tag always points at the
most recent release. The images and the Helm chart are public on GHCR, so they pull
without `docker login`.

## Installation

This fork supports two deployment paths:

* **Simple local stack** — a single [`docker-compose.yaml`](docker-compose.yaml) that builds
  the backend and web-frontend from source with PostgreSQL, Redis and a Caddy proxy on one
  origin:

  ```bash
  cp .env.compose.example .env   # then set the secrets
  docker compose up -d --build   # http://localhost
  ```

* **Kubernetes, OpenShift or Amazon EKS** — the [Helm chart](deploy/helm/baserow) deploys
  the backend, web-frontend and Celery workers as hardened pods. It is published to GHCR
  as an OCI artifact:

  ```bash
  helm install baserow oci://ghcr.io/carneirofc/baserow/charts/baserow \
    -n baserow --create-namespace --set publicURL=https://baserow.example.com
  ```

  PostgreSQL and Redis are optional, toggleable subcharts; media uses S3 object storage.
  Routing works through an Ingress, an AWS ALB IngressGroup or OpenShift Routes, and the
  pods run under OpenShift's default `restricted-v2` SCC with no security-profile changes.
  On EKS, S3 access can use IRSA or Pod Identity so no AWS credentials are stored at all.
  See [Installing with Helm](docs/installation/install-with-helm.md) and
  [Installing on Amazon EKS](docs/installation/install-on-eks.md).

For a single-container deployment, the all-in-one image
`ghcr.io/carneirofc/baserow/baserow` (embedded PostgreSQL + Redis) is published by CI and
covered by the generic [Docker](docs/installation/install-with-docker.md) guide.
